"""Connection lifecycle handlers.

Attachment to a room happens in lobby.enter_room, not here, so `connect` is a
no-op. `disconnect` resolves the sid back to a player and marks them offline —
but only if the disconnecting sid is still that player's current sid, which
avoids a stale page-unload socket knocking a freshly reconnected player offline.
