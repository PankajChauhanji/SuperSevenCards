"""The turn-timer director — the only background routine in the app.

Once a second it scans active rooms for a turn that has run past its deadline
and resolves it: auto-play a discard (or auto-draw if one was owed), and remove
a player who hits the timeout limit. It then broadcasts the consequences. This
is what keeps an AFK player from freezing the table.

For single-player rooms the bot (Suryavanshi) is detected here and its moves
are scheduled with a random human-feel delay without touching the group-play
code paths at all.

Run as an eventlet background task started in app.py.
