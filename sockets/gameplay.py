"""Gameplay handlers: throwing cards and drawing.

All authority lives here and in the room — the client only sends a selection of
card ids; the server decides whether it is legal, what action it is, and what
happens next. After every change the room broadcasts an authoritative
`table_state` snapshot (counts only) plus a private `your_hand` to whoever's
hand changed, so clients never drift from server truth.

call_stop and the turn timer arrive in later phases.
