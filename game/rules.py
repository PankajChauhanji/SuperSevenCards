"""Pure move-validation logic — the heart of Super Seven.

No sockets, no room state: just "given these card ranks (and what's on the
table), what legal action is this, if any?". Kept dependency-free so it can be
unit-tested exhaustively.

Action inference priority (locked decision): when a selection qualifies as both
a no-draw combo (set/sequence) AND a match, it is treated as the combo, because
the player always prefers not to draw.
