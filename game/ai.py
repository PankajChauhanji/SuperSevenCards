"""AI move logic — SINGLE-PLAYER MODE ONLY.

This module is only imported / called by the bot-turn branch in
sockets/director.py.  Nothing in the normal multiplayer path touches it,
so it cannot break group games even if it raises an exception.

Strategy (roughly human-skill):
  1. No-draw combos (Set / Sequence) — shed the most cards with no draw.
  2. Free Match (when MATCH_REQUIRES_DRAW is False) — also costs nothing.
  3. Largest Match that owes a draw — still better than discarding one card.
  4. Pair — throw two of a kind, draw one (net -1 card).
  5. Discard the single highest-value card, draw one (net 0 cards, lowest pts).

Stop-calling:
  Call Stop only when ALL of:
    • first orbit is complete
    • bot's hand total ≤ BOT_STOP_THRESHOLD
    • no opponent is already safe (safe = 0 pts, can't be beaten)
    • bot's total is strictly less than the opponent's *current* hand total
      (defensive — never risk the penalty if it could be a tie)

Randomised delay (human-feel):
  The caller (director) waits BOT_THINK_MIN .. BOT_THINK_MAX seconds before
  acting.  Using random keeps it feeling natural rather than robotic.
